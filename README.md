 <h1> Assignment</h1>
 
 <body>Do the tutorial https://www.raywenderlich.com/6184-unity-2017-2d-techniques-build-a-2d-pinball-game  from scratch. Add an intro screen with instructions of how to play, especially which buttons to use for flippers and bumping. Personalize the game by having the player enter his name, and use it during gameplay. Add more numbers to the gameplay, not just the total score. think of balls played, games played, etc. On the exit screen, have the score for the last game but also a high score for all games played (not by other players, that may come later). Give the option to play again or quit. Maybe add different / multiple sound effects. Have adjustments for speed of play with sliders or dropdowns.
